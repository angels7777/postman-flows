# Data Types

Postman Flows in its heart is a dataflow language, which means that there flows
understands all kinds of values and associates a type to data. It should also be
noted that Flows in a hybrid typed language, which means that it perform static 
type checking to provide features like auto-complete and early warning, and it 
also performs some dynamic type checking during execution. Our intention, in the long run, is to move Flows towards being
strictly typed language over a period of time. 

We are assuming most flow programmers would either be coming from a 
javascript/typescript background, or it might be their first time programming in 
an API-First language; therefore we have tried to keep the vocabulary of the 
types close to javascript/typescript.

## Primitive Values
| type | What it accepts | Example|
|---------|-----------------|--------|
|bool     | **true** or **false** | `true`|
|string   | utf-8 encoded characters |`foo ðŸ˜Ž bar` |
|number   | double precision 64-bit values or 64bit unsigned integers| `3.14` <br> `4294967295`|
|timestamp| string containing RFC3339 timestamp| `1985-04-12T23:20:50.52Z`|
|null     | Exactly one value **null** | `null`
|regex    | A regular expression | `/ab+c/`|
|datatype | Symbol of any data type | `string` <br> `bool` <br> `null` |
|range (pre-proposal) | A range value | `0..10` |

### Boolean
The boolean value can contain two symbols `true` or `false` as with any programming language. The Boolean type is represented by the symbol `bool`.

The *boolean* value gets automatically converted to a *number* or a *string* if required.
|value|number|string|
|-----|------|------|
|`true`| `1`| `'true'`|
|`false`| `0` | `'false'`|

### String
The String type is used to represent textual data. It is a utf-8 encoded list of characters. Just like javascript, string in Flows are also immutable, i.e once a string is created, it cannot be modified. But you can always create new strings out of existing string using operators like *concat* or *substring*.

> ðŸ’¡ Tip: JSON values are of type string. To make sense of that data they serialize needs perform step called parsing to can generate a complex data-structure of primitive types. The `Send Request` block performs the parsing automatically if the `content-type` header hints at a JSON body. In cases where this automatic parsing does not take place, one will need to parse the string using the `JSON Parse` block.

A *string* value cannot get converted automatically to any other type.

### Number
The number type in Flows can represent all kinds of numerical values, like Integers, Decimals, etc. Temporarily, the number internally are stored as javascript numbers, but this is going to change account for 64-bit integers and providing a unified number type.

A *number* value gets automatically converted to a *string* or *boolean* if required.
|value|boolean|string|
|-----|------|------|
|`0`| false | `'0'`|
|`3.14`| true | `'3.14'`|

### Timestamp
Unlike javascript, Flows consider dates are first-class type and provide a data type for storing dates. Dates are stored in-accordance to [RFC 3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339).

A *timestamp* value gets automatically converted to a *string* or *number* if required.
|value|string|number|
|-----|------|------|
|`1985-04-12T23:20:50.52Z`|`'1985-04-12T23:20:50.52Z'`| `482196050520`|

### Null

A *null* value represent a reference to non-existent values. Generally, any datatype could contain a null value instead of their actual value. In an API-First world it is very common to find this occurrence. The only possible value for the null type is `null`.

Because this is so common, in order to prevent null pointer exceptions, Flow performs some deterministic automatic conversion for null value.

|value |boolean|string|number|regex |timestamp|
|------|-------|------|------|------|--------|
|`null`|`false`| `''` |`0`   |`/$^/`|`0000-00-00T00:00:00Z`|

### Regex
Regular expressions are patterns which can be used to match character combinations in strings. Flows borrows Javascript regular expression implementation. [Read More on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions).

A *regex* value gets automatically converted to a *string* if required.
|value|string|
|-----|------|
|`/$^/`|`'/$^/'`|

### Range (Pre-Proposal) - TBD
*Note: Ranges are still in pre-proposal stage and might not be implemented*
